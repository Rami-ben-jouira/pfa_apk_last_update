The child places their left hand and uses the index finger of their right hand (or vice versa) to trace the outline of the hand. Inhale while moving up, and exhale while moving down.",
  "emotionalWaveDescription": "When you feel a difficult emotion, imagine it as a passing wave. Imagine this wave rising and falling within you. You can calmly surrender to the movement of the wave, noticing the intensity of your emotion as it rises and then falls. Accompany this emotional wave until it disappears. After the wave passes, you can say goodbye to your painful emotion.\n\nRemember, and say in an inner voice:\n\nEmotions are temporary.\nEmotions are useful, and if we accept them, they allow us to take appropriate actions.\nAvoiding emotions is what prolongs their duration and intensity.\nAvoiding emotions leads to impulsive actions, loss of control, and negative behaviors.",
